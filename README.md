# html-css-js-learn-template

## 2024-03-23 CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS

This weekend, my plan is to get this project finished as a "one-stop template for HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites" for people learning web development before they start with JavaScript Frameworks. The idea is: if you are learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript, then build websites with this structure since it is a pathway toward the structure of JavaScript frameworks.

This template is part of [Edward's tech starters](https://tanguay-eu.vercel.app/starters) project.

## limitations

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites in general have serious limitations in terms of user features and developer experience
  - this site is meant to be an academic exercise in order to learn the limits of HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites
- if you want more functionality
  - e.g. if you want to have a backend CRUD API, to use TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, axios, etc.
- and especially if you are studying to work as a web developer
- then spend your time instead learning **JavaScript frameworks**:
	- [React](https://react.dev) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
	- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) / [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)
	- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) / [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
	- [Angular](https://angular.io)
	- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
	- [Remix](https://remix.run)
	- [Astro](https://astro.build)
	- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io)

## features

Regardless of the above limitations, if you want to learn the basics of web development, this template is a good academic exercise showing you how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in a realistic environment to create useful, online-hosted websites.

- read-only data sources
    - display rich, structured data from your own JSON files
    - fetch and display data from open APIs that don't have CORS limitations
- component based 
	- learn to program in self-enclosed components that can be reused
	- this is an essential feature of JavaScript frameworks
- modern directory structure
  - with /src directory, similar to JavaScript frameworks
- easy to publish free at Vercel with a reasonable URL 
	- literally publish your site to the web in seconds
- simple page router
  - enables a navigation bar 
  - users can link to, bookmark and resturn to specific pages
